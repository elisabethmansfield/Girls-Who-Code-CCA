    <h1>Welcome to Carolyn's Page!!</h1>
    <p> <strong>My name is Carolyn, and I'm thrilled to be making this site. I've been facinated with Christian Apologetics for at least 2 years now, and I thought 
      it would be great to share some of my findings. This page will be split into a few main sections to prove that, no, Christians are not blind, superstitious
      robots. We can back up our beliefs with SCIENCE. Just to clarify, I'm not here to judge your beliefs. But I <em>do</em> want to give you the facts.
      So just consider what I have to say. It might just change your thinking.
      Before we officially begin, here is a video to kick this off: </strong> </p>

      <strong>Most of the information on my site will fall under 3 catagories:</strong>

    I. Biology

    II. Astronomy

    <h2>
    <strong>I. Biology</strong>
  </h2>
  
    <h3> <div class= "h3Bio">
      Introduction: You've probably heard of the Big Bang Theory. No, not the TV series. The Scientific Theory. The theory that there was a big boom of all these 
      elements, and then life just sprang up. But as we look at the intricate design of all life on earth, you'll realize that <em>it's just to complicated to just
      be an accident.</em> It had to be created by <em>someone.</em> This is the theory of Intelligent Design. In my Biology section,
      I'm going to present evidence to you proving this theory.</div>
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> <strong>Some evidence of Intelligent Design lies right in our own body....</strong> </li>

      </p>  
        
      
      <li><strong>Language and Information:</strong>I think we can all agree on two basic things here: 1. The code in our DNA 
      is the most complex language ever known, 2. Language always must come from a mind.
      <pre>
      </pre>
       Can you think of one language or message that wasn't written by a mind?
        <pre>
        </pre>
        If we are to believe these two points,then it directly points to a creator. The language containing hereditary information would have to
        have been written by <em>something</em> and it's far more complex than any language humankind can produce. 
        Conclusion: The language of DNA had to have been written by someone. The only being that could have done this was GOD.

    Intro: As with Biology, our Universe is just to perfect to have been made by accident. This section will be dedicated to explaining the
      complexity of the galaxy (and beyond!) that we live in.

        <strong>Earth. Our own planet. But do you know just how precisely designed it is? Everything had to be just right to be 
        just right to support life. </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Location: </strong>The earth is the PERFECT distance from the sun to support life. 
          Even the smallest change to earth's distance from the 
          sun would cause us to all burn up or freeze. <em>So how could it just happen</em> 
          that earth exists at a perfect location in the entire universe
          to support life?
          </li>
        <li><strong>Tilt:</strong> the tilt of the earth makes it perfect for our survival. If it were tilted any other way, 
          the earth would be too hot in some places and too cold in other places. </li>

    <h3>
      A lot of times, you will hear that the fossil record proves that we evolved from lower life forms. But does it really? Here's a super cool video
      to address this oft-debated topic:

      Conclusion

    <h3>
      <bold>So all in all, there is a <em>lot</em> of evidence that points to intelligent design in this world.</bold>

    <h3>
      So what did you think? I really hope that at least one of these facts made you really consider the case for a God of creation.
