      This photo shows the order of the planets. The order is:SUN MERCURY VENUS EARTH MARS JUPITER SATURN URANUS NEPTUNE PLUTO(unfortunately not a planet any more)
   
    The sun is a star. The universe is filled with galaxies and the most distant ones are moving away from us at more than 90 percent of the speed of light
    astronomy- science of that deals with celestial objects, space, and the physical universe as a whole. Black holes gobble up material that strays too near them.
    The Sun is over 300000 times larger than earth. Asteroids are also known as planetoids or minor planets. Once nuclear fusion has began in the core, a star is sufficiently fuelled to spend the majority of its life as a main sequence star in its most stable form. 
    Stars are usually between 1 and 10 billion years old. Some stars may even be close to the age of the observed Universe at nearly 13.8 billion years old. A star is a massive, bright, sphere of very hot gas called plasma which is held together by its own gravity. There are approximately 200-400 billion stars in our Milky Way Galaxy alone.  
      The Moon is the Earth’s only natural satellite. A natural satellite is a space body that orbits a planet, a planet like object or an asteroid. The Moon orbits the Earth every 27.3 days. Jupiter has a thin ring system.
Its rings are composed mainly of dust particles ejected from some of Jupiter’s smaller worlds during impacts from incoming comets and asteroids. The ring system begins some 92,000 kilometres above Jupiter’s cloud tops and stretches out to more than 225,000 km from the planet. They are between 2,000 to 12,500 kilometres thick. The largest planet in the solar system is Jupiter, followed by Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Earth, Venus, Mars with the smallest being Mercury.
    Venus does not have any moons or rings.
Venus is nearly as big as the Earth with a diameter of 12,104 km.
Venus is thought to be made up of a central iron core, rocky mantle and silicate crust.
A day on the surface of Venus (solar day) would appear to take 117 Earth days.
A year on Venus takes 225 Earth days.
The surface temperature on Venus can reach 471 °C.
      Neptune has 14 moons.
The Most interesting moon is Triton, a frozen world that is spewing nitrogen ice and dust particles out from below its surface. It was likely captured by the gravitational pull of Neptune. It is probably the coldest world in the solar system.
