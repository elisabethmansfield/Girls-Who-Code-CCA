    <h1>Welcome to Maddie's Page!</h1>
    <p1>
      Welcome to my page! On here you will learn all about human biology and botany (because those two are so similar). 
      <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/86/73/d6/8673d62f883fa7993c95acc2517ac1a6--typography-quotes-math-humor.jpg">click here</a> for a funny math joke if you're into that stuff.

    <h2>
      Botany
    </h2>
    <p1>
      Botany is the study of plants. Although you might not think so, plants are very interesting. You might be thinking What could possibly be interesting about plants, I see them every single day and nothing ever happens. They're so boring! Or are they? Maybe you just have to look deeper than the surface.

      Plants are living things made up of cells. You may be thinking how dumb do you think I am; but what you probably don't realize is that because plants are alive they can feel things.

  <strong>Think about this, plants know and feel when you eat them. Read this to find out more.

      Thoughs are plant cells. Oh no! We can't see any of the organelles! Let's zoom in so we can see them.

      Obviously this isn't a real plant cell but it is a good diagram of one. Wait, what do all of the lables mean? Well, those are all very important key terms, so you'll need to know those definitions.

      <li>  <p1>
      Golgi Apparatus- it sorts and processes proteins. It is made out of stacked membrane-bound sacks.

      </li>
     <li><p2>
    Mitochondria- produce energy (this is a simplified definition)

      <p3>
        ribosomes-make protein for the cell</p3></li>

        Vacuole-stores food and waste of cell
          </p4></li>
        <li><p3>
        cell wall-the rigid outer layer of plant cells. Cell walls are <strong> only </strong> in plant cells.
